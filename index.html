Group Proposal-Flappy Bird <br><br>

Introduction <br><br>


Flappy Bird is a 2013 mobile game, developed by Vietnam-based developer Dong Nguyen and published by GEARS Studios, a small independent game developer also based in Vietnam. The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between rows of green pipes without hitting them. <br>
<br>


Flappy Bird was originally released as a mobile game, but shortly after it blew up in popularity the developer removed it from all mobile app stores. Our game will be a take on Flappy Bird made for the Pitt student and alumni. An updated look will consist of the Pitt mascot, Roc the Panther dodging popular Pitt student attractions, and famous Pitt landmarks. Similar to Flappy Bird, Roc will be in a consistent state of falling. Clicking the mouse will make Roc jump up the screen. Roc will have to dodge objects at the top and bottom of the screen. As Roc dodges objects the player’s score will increase. Players will have different difficulty options to select from at the start of the game. <br>
